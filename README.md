icpc 2019 Problem E

The pdf file contains the specifications for the problem as well as a example for in- and output.
The cpp file is my implementation of a solution, it requires only input of a filepath (to an input) via the terminal.
The result is then printed out in the terminal. The code does NOT pause after the output!
The data folder contains sample input files, corresponding output files and png files that illustrate the corresponding input/output.
